# evolabs

This is the root directory for our data collection app, which we've dubbed evolabs.

**Important note**: flutter apps are *notoriously* picky about the environment in which they are built. You can run `flutter build apk` in *this* directory (evolabs) to build an apk which you can install to a developer options and usb debugging enabled Android phone with `adb install path/to/your.apk`. 

Should you have issues building the code locally you can get an auto-built version of the from the [releases](https://github.com/CSC4562-Evolabs/CSC4562-Project1/releases) page on this repository. These are automatically built using GitHub Actions, and I (Sam Hildebrand) set that up specifically because it can be tedious to setup to build flutter code on a local machine. You can see the GitHub actions script that builds these releases [here](https://github.com/CSC4562-Evolabs/CSC4562-Project1/blob/main/.github/workflows/automated-release.yml)

## Note:
Should you have **any** problems building or installing the app, please do not hesitate to contact me, Sam Hildebrand, at my lsu.edu email address, which is listed with this link in the project report. Thank you!
